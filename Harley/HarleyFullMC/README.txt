=====================
PCB Fabrication notes:
=====================
* Fab quantity: full panel yield (presumably this will be 20 or so?)
* Board outline is a rectangle, 33mm x 45mm = 1.30" x 1.77"
* 10 layers
* PCB thickness is not critical. 62mil is fine.
* Copper weights are not critical (everything is relatively low-power). However, impedances are important due to DDR3 and other high-speed traces.
* stackup was started using the included "stackup.pdf" report generated by Sierra's "HDI Stackup Planner" website. We do require the following impedances for these trace widths and layer pairs (+/- 10%)
  * layer 1:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm referenced to layer 2
  * layer 2:  solid ground plane
  * layer 3:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm referenced to layer 2
  * layer 4:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm referenced to layer 5
  * layer 5:  split power planes
  * layer 6:  split power planes
  * layer 7:  some planes and some 5mil traces => 50 ohm referenced to layer 6
  * layer 8:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm referenced to layer 9
  * layer 9:  solid ground plane
  * layer 10: signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm referenced to layer 10

* Minimum trace/space is 5mil.
* All holes plated
* Minimum via-drill 7 mil, minimum via-pad 13 mil
* Minimum micro-via drill 6 mil, minimum micro-via pad 13 mil
* FR4 material
* HASL finish
* Green soldermask both sides
* White silkscreen both sides

=====================
Assembly notes:
=====================
* Assembly quantity: 5 units.
  * If these units work as expected, we may request assembly of the rest of the PCB's.
* Double-sided assembly, but all large/heavy parts are on top side.
* All parts can be washed
* RoHS processing is fine but not strictly necessary; these are laboratory prototypes.
* All surface-mount components need to be procured and installed (turnkey).
  * The included BOM provides all distributor and manufacturer part numbers
* All through-hole connectors are DNP; we will populate ourselves as needed.

Shipping notes:
=====================
Please send finished assemblies and extra bare-boards to:

   ATTN: Morgan Quigley
   OSRF
   170 S. Whisman Road
   Bldg. D, Suite A
   Mountain View, CA 94041

Derivatives of this board will be fabricated in higher quantities in the future. DFM feedback is requested. We are just starting to enter the brave new world of HDI and have much to learn.
