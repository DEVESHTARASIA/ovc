PCB Fabrication notes:
* Board outline is a rectangle, 33mm x 45mm = 1.30" x 1.77"
* 10 layers
* PCB thickness is not critical. 62mil is fine.
* stackup was started using the included "stackup.pdf" report generated by Sierra's "HDI Stackup Planner" website. However, we do require the following impedances for these trace widths and layer pairs (+/- 10%)
  * layers  1-2: 5mil traces = 50 ohm
  * layers  3-2: 5mil traces = 50 ohm
  * layers 10-9: 5mil traces = 50 ohm
  * Copper weights are not critical (everything is relatively low-power).

6 mil minimum trace/space on annular rings. Minimum trace/space is 5mil.
All holes plated
Minimum via-drill 7 mil, minimum via-pad 16 mil
FR4 material
HASL finish
Green soldermask both sides
White silkscreen both sides
All parts can be washed
RoHS processing is not necessary; these are laboratory prototypes.
Double-sided assembly, but all large parts are on top side.

All through-hole connectors are DNP; we will populate ourselves as needed.

All surface-mount components are requested to be procured and installed (turnkey). The included BOM provides distributor and manufacturer part numbers for all surface-mount components.

Requested fab quantity: full panel yield (presumably this will be 20 or so?)

Requested assembly quantity: 5 units.

Please send finished assemblies and extra bare-boards to:

Derivatives of this board will be fabricated in higher quantities in the future. DFM feedback is requested.
