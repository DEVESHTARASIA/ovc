=====================
PCB Fabrication notes:
=====================
* Lead time: 4 days
* Fab quantity: full panel yield (presumably this will be 20 or so?)
* Board outline is a rectangle, 33mm x 45mm = 1.30" x 1.77"
* 10 layers
* micro-vias between the outermost layers (layers 1+2, and layer 9+10). All other vias are through-vias.
* 62 mil PCB thickness
* Copper weights are not critical (everything is relatively low-power). However, impedances are important due to DDR3 and other high-speed traces.
* stackup was started using the included "stackup.pdf" report generated by Sierra's "HDI Stackup Planner" website. We do require the following impedances for these trace widths and layer pairs (+/- 10%)
  * layer 1:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 2:  solid ground plane
  * layer 3:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 4:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 5:  split power planes
  * layer 6:  split power planes
  * layer 7:  some planes and some 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 8:  signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm
  * layer 9:  solid ground plane
  * layer 10: signal, 5mil traces => 50 ohm

* Minimum trace/space is 5mil.
* All holes plated
* Minimum via-drill 7 mil, minimum via-pad 13 mil
* Minimum micro-via drill 6 mil, minimum micro-via pad 13 mil
* FR4 material
* HASL finish
* Green soldermask both sides
* White silkscreen both sides

=====================
Assembly notes:
=====================
* Lead time: 4 days
* Assembly quantity: 5 units.
* Double-sided assembly, but all large/heavy parts are on top side.
* U4 is an image sensor. We are not sure about the best practices for them, and defer to Sierra's expertise about whether these parts can be washed.
* RoHS processing is fine but not strictly necessary; these are laboratory prototypes.
* All surface-mount components need to be procured and installed (turnkey).
  * The included BOM provides all distributor and manufacturer part numbers
* Three resistors and three connectors are marked DNP; otherwise, please install all components.

Shipping notes:
=====================
Please send finished assemblies and extra bare-boards to:

   ATTN: Morgan Quigley

Derivatives of this board will be fabricated in higher quantities in the future. DFM feedback is requested. We are just starting to enter the brave new world of HDI and have much to learn.
